1. background-image:
    - if we want grediant or  overlay over image than we can pass both at once
        ```css
                background-image: linear-gradient(to right bottom, rgba(126, 213, 111, 0.8), rgba(40, 180, 133, 0.8)), url('/img/hero.jpg');
        ```
    - background-size and background-position often use with image:
        ```css
                background-size: cover;
                background-position: top; 
        ```

2.  clip-path:
     - this use for give shape to image like triangle , or any other plygon shape.
        ```css
            clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75%, 0 100%);
        ```
3. remove default style
   - in **ul=>**    `list-style: none;` 
   - remove **underline and color from link=>**   `text-decoration: none;`
   -
